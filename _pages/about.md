Hi, I'm Liz and I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the [Space Telescope Science Institute](https://www.stsci.edu/home) in the [ISM* group](https://www.ismstar.space/). I'm an observational astronomer that is broadly interested in understanding the multiphase nature of the interstellar medium in nearby galaxies, with a focus on metal-poor dwarf galaxies. My research is inherently multiwavelength, and I love working with a variety of telescopes such as JWST, ALMA, HST, GBT, Spitzer, Herschel, and the VLA. 

I grew up in central New Jersey and received my BS in Astronomy and Physics at [Case Western Reserve University](https://astronomy.case.edu/) in Cleveland, Ohio. I earned my PhD in Astronomy at the [University of Maryland](https://www.astro.umd.edu/) under the advisement of [Professor Alberto Bolatto](https://www.astro.umd.edu/~bolatto/). Outside of astronomy, I love live music, tabletop RPGs, and crocheting.
