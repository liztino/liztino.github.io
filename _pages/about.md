Hi, I'm Liz and I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the [Space Telescope Science Institute](https://www.stsci.edu/home) in the [ISM* group](https://www.ismstar.space/). I'm an observational astronomer that is broadly interested in understanding the multiphase nature of the interstellar medium in nearby galaxies. I love working with a variety of telescopes such as JWST, ALMA, HST and the VLA. My favorite objects are star-forming dwarf galaxies and I aim to understand the impact these low metallicity galaxies have on their stars and ISM.
